# AI Desktop Assistant

## 🧠 Project Overview
AI Desktop Assistant is an intelligent voice-based personal assistant built using Python. It can perform various tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, telling the time and date, fetching information, playing music, sending emails, and more — all through simple voice commands.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎙️ Voice recognition and response  
- 🌐 Web search and Wikipedia integration  
- 🕒 Time, date, and weather updates  
- 📂 Open system applications and files  
- 💬 Text-to-speech responses  
- 📧 Send emails or messages via voice  
- 🔔 Custom reminders and notes  

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python  
- SpeechRecognition  
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)  
- Wikipedia API  
- datetime  
- webbrowser  
- os  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The assistant listens for a wake command (like “Hey Assistant”).  
2. It processes your voice input using SpeechRecognition.  
3. The command is analyzed and executed (e.g., open a file, search online).  
4. The response is given back via text-to-speech.

## 🪄 Example Commands
- "Open YouTube"  
- "What’s the time now?"  
- "Search Python programming on Google"  
- "Tell me about Artificial Intelligence"  
- "Play music"
